# Simple Linear Rregression-ML
Simple linear regression is used to find out the best relationship between a single input variable (predictor, independent variable, input feature, input parameter) & output variable (predicted, dependent variable, output feature, output parameter) provided that both variables are continuous in nature. This relationship represents how an input variable is related to the output variable and how it is represented by a straight line.
